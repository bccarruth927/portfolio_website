            <h2>A Little About Me!</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Hello! I want to thank you for stopping by to check out my portfolio and learning a little about me! I'm going to keep
                    this professional by detailing my skills and experience to offer you a broader view of my capabilities beyond
                    what I can do inside a resume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a mostly self-taught developer who first step foot into the world of tech and programming when I volunteered to build
                    the family business a website to help boost our digital foothold. I utilized everything I could find at my disposal from online
                    bootcamps like <strong>freecodecamp</strong> and <strong>Codecademy</strong> to YouTube tutorials and the StackOverflow forums.
                    This led me to re-enroll in college and pursue a second Bachelors degree in the computer science field which I achieved in August, 2023
                    when I received my degree in Digital Media and Web Technology from the University of Maryland Global Campus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My coursework at UMGC provided me many opportunities to learn a variety of skills pertaining to web development, software engineering
                    and graphic design. A few of these skills include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML5 & CSS programming languages</li>
                    <li>JavaScript (including the jQuery, Ajax and JSON libraries)</li>
                    <li>LESS (CSS preprocessor)</li>
                    <li>UX and UI principles</li>
                    <li>Adobe Creative Suite (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After a few years of self-teaching and a year of collegiate level coursework I discovered I had a real passion for programming as well as
                    researching and solving problems. I continued my own self-taught education by expanding on what I learned in college to more advanced forms
                    of the programming languages as well as industry standard tools and programming languages more suited to application development. In addition
                    to the programming languages I learned in school I also have sufficient knowledge in the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>React.js JavaScript library</li>
                    <li>Git and GitHub</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>Java (including GUI)</li>
                    <li>The Linux OS (primarily the Ubuntu distribution)</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I am continuing to learn even more! Currently I am learning Python as well as experimenting using Java to build an application that works on
                    the Android OS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the programming languages and other hard technical skills I have learned and am learning I also have an abundance of transferrable
                    skills that I have developed through my work experiences. A few of these skills include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong communication</li>
                    <li>Time management</li>
                    <li>Easily adaptable</li>
                    <li>Collaboration and teamwork</li>
                    <li>Leadership</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Several of these skills have won me awards from my previous places of employment and extracurricular organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and the skills I can bring to an organization and development team! If you wish to contact
                    me I can be reached through the social medias provided in the footer of this webpage. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
