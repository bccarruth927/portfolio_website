# Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my person ePortfolio. I built this project to help me demonstrate my skills as a developer and software engineer
to prospective employers.

## Features

There are several features incorporated into the website

- A projects page to demonstrate the work I have been doing with links to the repositories on GitHub
- An about section on the landing page detailing my educational and work backgrounds
- Responsive design so the website is user friendly on both mobile and desktop platforms

## How to Use

The ePortfolio doesn't contain any features that are unique and require further explanation. The user simply navigates and browses the
portfolio as they would any other website :D

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- LESS (CSS preprocessor)
- JavaScript (jQuery.js)
