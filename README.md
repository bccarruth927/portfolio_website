# Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my person ePortfolio. I built this project to help me demonstrate my skills as a developer and software engineer
to prospective employers. The goal is for this ePortfolio to serve as a temporary subsitution for my lack of relevant work experience within
the computer science industry. Ideally I will grow the portfolio as my skill sets develop and I gain some actual work experience.

## Features

There are several features incorporated into the website

- A responsive navigation menu visible on each seperate page of the ePortfolio
- An about page to better describe my skills and experiences to supplement the resume
- A projects page with descriptions of my most relevant projects with links to their GitHub repositoires
- A contact page with functioning contact form
- A downloadable PDF of my most up-to-date resume

## How to Use

The ePortfolio doesn't contain any features that are unique and require further explanation. The user simply navigates and browses the
portfolio as they would any other website :D

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- LESS (CSS preprocessor)
- JavaScript (jQuery.js)
