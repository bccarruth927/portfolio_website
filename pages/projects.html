                            In March of 2024 I successfully completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification program where I learned the skills necessary to be
                            a skilled entry-level cybersecurity professional. I compiled a collection of projects I completed throughout the program that demonstrate the skills and fundamental
                            knowledge I have obtained that make me valuable asset to an organization's blue team. I am also continuing my learning and skill development by learning the fundamentals
                            of pentesting and red team responsibilities<br>

                            In August of 2023 I authored the documention page for the array_splice() method in PHP for the Codecademy Docs open-source
                            project. The skills I demonstrated undergoing this project are the technical skills I have in the Git tool and navigating a
                            GitHub repository, a fundamental knowledge of PHP and my skills in collaboration and communication as I worked with Codecademy
                            moderators to publish the documentation page.<br>

                            I created this fun little terminal game using my understanding of the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and the Python
                            programming language. The game functions inside of the computer terminal and is capable of collecting user input to create a unique gaming experience.
                            Includes all the basics of OOP and Python including classes and objects, functions, loops, conditional statements and variables<br>

                            This is one of my favorite projects that I have worked on to date! It is a web application consisting
                            of calculators designed to calculate the cubic yardage of concrete based on user provided data. This project
                            enabled me to practice JavaScript which was one of the languages I wanted to learn the most but originally
                            found the most challenging.<br>

                            I built this project to help myself better understand and practice the React.js JavaScript library. Given it is
                            one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in use today I wanted to have it as a part of my skill set. I was able
                            to practice many aspects of the library including using JSX, making and connecting components and the use of hooks to
                            change the DOM instead of directly altering it.<br>

                            You didn't think I'd not incorporate my own ePortfolio website in my list of projects did you? Of course you didn't! My ePortfolio
                            I felt was important to include because it encapsulates not only all that I've learned but all my skills prominently on display in one
                            place. I'm quite proud of how well it turned out! Additionally since this is my own personal portfolio I can experiment with different
                            features and also have an archive which I can reference if I want to replicate similar designs or effects on future projects!<br>
