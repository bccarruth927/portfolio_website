                        enabled me to practice JavaScript which was one of the languages I wanted to learn the most but originally

                        I built this project to help myself better understand and practice the React.js JavaScript library. Given it is
                        one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in use today I wanted to have it as a part of my skill set. I was able
                        to practice many aspects of the library including using JSX, making and connecting components and the use of hooks to
                        change the DOM instead of directly altering it.<br>

                        The premise of the project was to help me learn and understand some of the basic fundamentals of JavaScript such as the use of
                        variables, functions and conditionals. I wanted to include this project in my portfolio to demonstrate I have a firm understanding
                        of one of the most widely used programming languages in the world!<br>

                        I felt was important to include because it encapsulates not only all that I've learned but all my skills prominently on display in one
                        place. I'm quite proud of how well it turned out! Additionally since this is my own personal portfolio I can experiment with different
                        features and also have an archive which I can reference if I want to replicate similar designs or effects on future projects!<br>
