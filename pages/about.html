                <article>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I want to thank you for stopping by my about page and learning a little about me! I'm going to keep
                        this professional by detailing my skills and experience to offer you a broader view of my capabilities beyond
                        what I can do inside a resume.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll start with my educational background! I graduated from Frostburg State University with a Bachelor of Science
                        degree in Law & Society with a minor in Graphic Design. My original plans for a career revolved around law enforcement.
                        However, graduating in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and many of the events surrounding law enforcement I became
                        very uncertain about this career path. I started working full time for the family construction business full time after
                        I graduated. After a few years I decided to re-enroll in school to focus on a career within computer science. January, 2022
                        I began the process of earning a second bachelor's degree from University of Maryland Global Campus while remaining employed
                        full time. I am on track to graduate UMGC in August 2023!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My coursework at UMGC provided me many opportunities to learn a variety of skills pertaining to web development, software engineering
                        and graphic design. A few of these skills include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML5 & CSS programming languages</li>
                            <li>JavaScript (including the jQuery, Ajax and JSON libraries)</li>
                            <li>LESS (CSS preprocessor)</li>
                            <li>UX and UI principles</li>
                            <li>Adobe Creative Suite (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            However, I discovered while learning in school that I developed a passion for coding. Often times hours would feel like minutes while I
                            was developing a website or troubleshooting a bug. So in addition to my official coursework during the intermissions between semesters I
                            learned more languages and tools from online coding bootcamps like <strong>freecodecamp</strong> and <strong>Codecademy</strong>. I supplemented
                            my existing knowledge on several languages learned in class as well as learned others such as:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>React.js JavaScript library</li>
                            <li>Git & GitHub</li>
                            <li>PHP</l>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Other langauges I want to learn and will pursue in the future include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>C++</li>
                            <li>Python</li>
                            <li>C#</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            As you can see I know a lot but also recognize I can always learn more!
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now for a little about my working experience. Currently I am lacking relevant work experience within the computer science industry though I am
                        actively pursing internship and entry level opportunities when I find them. Though I have been working for a large portion of my life. I started
                        working summers for the family business at the age of 13 and after going to college took a job in the student union building at Frostburg State.
                        These working experiences have provided me the opportunity to learn valuable skills that are essential in all industries.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Written and verbal communication</li>
                            <li>Time management</li>
                            <li>Adaptability</li>
                            <li>The ability to learn from and accept constructive criticism</li>
                            <li>Leadership</li>
                        </ul>
                        These are just a few of the soft skills I have learned from my previous work experiences. In fact while working for the student union I earned several
                        awards including Frostburg State's first ever <i>Student Employee of the Year</i> award. The student union's <i>Manager of the Year</i> award. I even was
                        awarded my local fraternity chapter's <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> award for inspiring positive growth and development in younger brothers.
                    </p>
                    <p>I could keep going on what makes me unique and why I would be a valuable addition to a development or engineering team. If you've made it to the end here
                        I want to thank you for taking the time and hope that I have provided a little more context to my resume!
